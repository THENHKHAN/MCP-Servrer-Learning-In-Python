1. AI's foundation rests on machine learning algorithms that can improve from experience without explicit programming.
2. Neural networks, inspired by human brain structure, are a key component of modern AI systems.
3. Generative AI models like large language models can create content after training on vast datasets.
4. Computer vision enables AI to interpret and understand visual information from the world.
5. Natural language processing allows AI to understand, interpret, and generate human language.
6. Reinforcement learning is a training method where AI learns optimal behaviors through trial and error with rewards/penalties.
7. AI ethics concerns include issues of bias, privacy, transparency, and ensuring systems benefit humanity.
8. AI alignment research focuses on ensuring advanced AI systems act in accordance with human values and intentions.
9. Edge AI refers to AI algorithms processed locally on a hardware device rather than in the cloud.
