# 🧠 Claude + FastMCP Integration Guide

This README explains how to use Claude (LLM) with a FastMCP server to build AI-powered systems that don’t just answer — they **act**.

---

## ❓ What Does Claude Do?

Claude acts as the **intelligent agent**.

When a user asks:

> "Can you add 5 and 9?"

Claude:
- Understands the intent.
- Chooses the correct tool (e.g. `add`).
- Calls the MCP server using structured input:

```json
{
  "tool": "add",
  "args": {
    "a": 5,
    "b": 9
  }
}
```
## ❓ What Does MCP Do?

The MCP server is the executor.

- Hosts your tools via `@mcp.tool` or `@mcp.resource`.
- Automatically generates machine-readable tool schemas.
- Receives structured requests from Claude.
- Executes your Python function and returns the result.

## 🔁 How the System Works

```text
User --> Claude (LLM predicts intent)
     --> Chooses a tool from MCP
     --> Sends structured request
     --> MCP executes the function
     --> Claude returns the response
```
## ❓ **Can this be done with a REST API?**

✅ **Yes**, but it requires:
- Manual endpoint creation
- OpenAPI documentation
- Tool discovery logic

⚡ **MCP** simplifies this with automatic tool registration and schema generation.

---

## ❓ **Does Claude automatically know my tools?**

✅ **Yes** — as long as they're registered with **MCP**.  
Claude receives descriptions and schemas for each tool via standard protocols.

---

## ❓ **Who predicts vs who executes?**

🧠 **Claude**: Predicts the correct tool and inputs based on the user's natural language.  
⚙️ **MCP**: Executes the actual Python function and returns the result.

---

## ❓ **Can this be done with a REST API?**

**Yes**, but you would need to build the routes, docs, schemas, and tool discovery yourself.  
⚡ **MCP** simplifies this by auto-registering and exposing tools in an LLM-friendly format.

---

## ❓ **Does Claude “know” the tools I created?**

**Yes** — if you register your tools properly using **FastMCP decorators**.  
Claude will receive descriptions and schemas of the tools and know what input they expect.

---

## ❓ **Who does the prediction? Who does the execution?**

- **Claude** `predicts` which tool to use and how to call it.
- **MCP** `executes` the actual function you defined.

---

## ❓ **How does MCP handle tool registration?**

**MCP** automatically registers tools, eliminating the need for manual configuration and endpoint setup.

---

## ❓ **What type of tools can MCP work with?**

**MCP** is designed to work with any Python-based function, turning them into tools for AI systems like **Claude** to interact with.

---

## ❓ **Do I need to manage tool schemas?**

No, **MCP** automatically generates machine-readable schemas for each tool, making integration easy and automatic.

# REST API vs MCP Server Comparison

| Feature                  | REST API           | MCP Server       |
|--------------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| **Manual routing**        | ✅ Required        | ❌ Not needed    |
| **Schema/docs generation**| ✅ Manual          | ✅ Automatic     |
| **AI-native tool support**| ❌ No              | ✅ Yes           |
| **Ideal for LLMs**        | ❌ Not directly    | ✅ Absolutely    |



## ✅ **Conclusion**

- **Claude** is the brain.  
- **MCP** is the muscle.  

Use **MCP** to expose your logic as tools. Let **Claude** decide when and how to use them based on user input.

>Together, they make an AI system that not only talks but also acts.
