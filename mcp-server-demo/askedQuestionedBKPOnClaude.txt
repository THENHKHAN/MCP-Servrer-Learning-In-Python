@AI Sticky Notes what are tools availbale?

Edit
I can see you'd like to know about the available tools in this environment. I have access to several tools that can help you:

Sticky Notes - I can add and read notes for you with the following functions:
add_note - Allows me to save a note with content you provide
read_notes - Allows me to retrieve all previously saved notes
Artifacts - I can create self-contained pieces of content like code, documents, SVG images, Mermaid diagrams, and React components. These artifacts can be referenced and updated throughout our conversation.
Would you like me to demonstrate how to use any of these tools, or do you have something specific you'd like to accomplish with them?


what are the notes?

Edit
Let me check what notes are currently saved.

read_notes


Here are the current notes I found:

"Noor is best."
"100 character"
Would you like me to add a new note, or is there anything else you'd like to do with these notes?

Summary of AI Notes
The stored notes provide a compact overview of AI concepts:

Core Technologies: AI is built on machine learning algorithms and neural networks that can learn and improve from data.
Key Capabilities: AI systems can generate content (generative AI), process visual information (computer vision), understand and produce language (NLP), and learn through rewards/penalties (reinforcement learning).
Important Considerations: The notes highlight ethical challenges (bias, privacy), the importance of alignment with human values, and emerging trends like edge computing and multimodal systems that combine different types of data processing.

Additionally, there are two earlier notes: "Noor is best" and "100 character" that appear unrelated to the AI topic.
